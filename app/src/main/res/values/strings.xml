Collect as many coins as possible using the capture options. The player with the most coins at the
        end of the game wins. The game is over when there are either no rounds left or no coins left
        to collect.\n\n\n

CAPTURE OPTIONS\n\n
1) Circle - Collects the nearest coins at 100 percent capture probability. Can be moved across the
        screen.\n\n
2) Rectangle - Collects the nearest coins and can be scaled. But the larger the
        rectangle, the lower is the probability of capturing the coins. The capture probability of
        the default rectangle is 50 percent.\n\n
3) Line - Collects the nearest coins and can be rotated. Has a 75 percent capture probability.\n\n\n
    NOTES\n\n
    Capture button will be enabled only when a capture option is selected.\n\n
    A round is over when both the players have used the capture button.\n\n
    Default number of rounds are 5 and player names are "Player 1" and "Player 2".\n\n

    Invalid number of rounds will result in default settings for the rounds.</string>
